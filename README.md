## Boris Bikes Afternoons Pairing Challenge
To pair with other members of the cohort in the afternoons and get the Boris Bikes challenge underway.
This involves TDD (test driven development) through Unit testing (smallest pieces of logic you can test in Rspec while TDDing) and Feature testing (can be bigger in scope than a unit test - maybe it's multiple small units that make up 1 feature, e.g. initialising a docking station, docking 20 bikes there, making sure multiple users can release bikes. Can be written in Rspec in feature_spec).
